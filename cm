Upgrade with new perftest v2 feature set

This commit adds new branch v2, adds util/flag.go and util/cw_put.go,
updates the Makefile to rebuild perftest if any source files have
changed, and improves the perftest app with the ability to publish
test results to AWS CloudWatch or via a webhook, and to send an alert if
performance exceeds some bound.

The README describes how to run the docker as on the Rafay platform.


TODO
-- create master branch and make it default (oops)
   git checkout v1
   git branch master
   git push
   git branch -D -r v1				# ???

   git branch v1
   git checkout v1
   git push					# v1 branch off master

   git branch v2
   git checkout v2
   ... will this work???

   TOO MUCH FUSSING
   just create master from v2
   then set to default in github (say OK to warning)

-- remove AWS environment variables from v1 branch (not needed).
-- modify perftest.go in v1 to default runtime to 1d
  (merge perftest.go from v1 to v2, but not Makefile).
